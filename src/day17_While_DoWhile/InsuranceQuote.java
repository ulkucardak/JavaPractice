			Insurance Quote calculation:
				starting prices for liability:
					age < 25 ===> 90
					age >= 25 ==> 50

					miles <= 10 ====> $10
				    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $30
				    miles > 50 ===>  $50

				starting prices for full coverage:
					age < 25 ===> 160
					age >= 25 ==> 120

					miles <= 10 ====> $20
				    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $40
				    miles > 50 ===>  $70


			    If the car has anti-theft device ==> 5% discount
			    If he/she had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ===> 15% extra charge
			    If he/she never had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ==> 10% discount
			    If he/she is married ==> 5% discount
